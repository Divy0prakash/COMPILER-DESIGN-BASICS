Task Description

The objective of this project is to implement a simple compiler in C++ that can parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions. The program should simulate the essential stages of a compiler, focusing on lexical analysis, parsing, and evaluation.

Key Features

Input Handling

Accept arithmetic expressions as input (e.g., 3 + 5 * (2 - 4)).

Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)

Breaks the input into meaningful tokens (numbers, operators, parentheses).

Example: "3 + 5" â†’ {NUM(3), PLUS, NUM(5)}.

Parsing (Grammar Implementation)

Follows a grammar for arithmetic expressions:
